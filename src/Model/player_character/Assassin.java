        setDescription("An Assassin is a nimble and quiet class, moving in darkness to strike at the unsuspecting. Locks hold no doors shut for them. Assassins are very adept at taking the lives of others, and are able to find the weak points of opponents, often able to fell those much more powerful than themselves. Because of their training, assassins are typically adept at using a wide variety of weapons; however, to maintain their stealthy cloak, assassins typically stick with light armor and rarely carry shields. Most assassins work outside of the law. However, some factions such as the Morag Tong and the Shadowscales are assassins for their ruler.");
